          I have a few hobbies but my favorite is playing chess 
          I also love swimming alot
          A fact about me is that my love for steak would never allow me to be vegitarian
          and also the amount of movie knowledge i have would scare you

           </p>
           <p>In terms of education , i would say my journey has been a roller coaster
             I decided to do programming beacause i love interacting with computers and learning new things
             also the dream of one day becoming a fullstack web developer lead me to this course
